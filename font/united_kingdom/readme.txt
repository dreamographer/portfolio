OTF: United Kingdom (Regular, Italic, and Outlines)

I stumbled upon a sharp and futuristic concept while working on a logo for a client. This didn't end up making it into the finished project but after designing more letters 
an entire alphabet evolved. The end result is Norwood; an all caps display font whose characters have unexpected corners where curves would normally be assumed. The line weight is 
consistent throughout and gives an "edgey" feel. Letters look great next to each other with very little kerning applied. Use the glyphs panel when working with Greek for proper 
diacritics. This typeface wasn't tailored for body text so check the glyph map for characters needed. Use United Kingdom for sports jerseys, logos, or action movie posters. 

 
Basic and extended latin, numbers, punctuation, European accents, diacritics, Cyrillic, Greek, and kerning, Italic, and Outlines are included in the full version. Basic Latin, numbers, 
and limited punctuation are included in the free demo. 

The complete version is available with purchase of commercial license or $20 via PayPal. Please note that this $20 is for PERSONAL use only and does not constitute a commercial license.

This font like my others are free for personal use only as long as this readme file stays intact. For commercial use please contact me at dennis@sharkshock.net to discuss an end user
license agreement. You can also visit www.sharkshock.net/license for more info and terms. I also design custom fonts for companies, logos, and many other things. If you'd like to leave 
me a PayPal donation you can use my email address above. Your generosity will be most appreciated! 

Thank you for your support!
